# Minesweeper  
https://minesweeperonline.com/

Minesweeper is a game with a rectangular grid with randomly placed spaces that have mines.  
The goal is to clear all the spaces that don't have mines.  
If you pick a space with a mine, you lose.  

If you pick a space that doesn't have a mine, it will show you how many mines are adjacent to that space.  

# Task
Your job is to implement numMinesAdjacent and isMine  
I've already written code to setup the board with random mines, print the board, and show what numMinesAdjacent returns for each space.  Try running the base code a few times before you start writing.  Think about what numMinesAdjacent should return for each space.  Think about where bounds errors might arise.  

# Grading
numMinesAdjacent - 3 pts
This should accurately count the number of adjacent mines without crashing.  
Read the spec carefully and be sure that you de everything that is asked.  

Regular commits - 3 pts
Your commits should demonstrate the progression of your work.  Commit regularly, not just at the end.  If you finish and save, it's too late.
